(** Type of a standard comparison function. *)
type 'a compare = 'a -> 'a -> int

(** [failwith ~fail fmt] is equivalent to calling [fail msg] (or, if [fail] is
    not given, [Stdlib.failwith msg]), where [msg] is an error message that is
    built from the format [fmt] and the extra arguments it specifies. Warning:
    the function must be fully applied for the exception to trigger. *)
