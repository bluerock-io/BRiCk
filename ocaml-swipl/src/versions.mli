(** [get_SYSTEM ()] gives the SWI-prolog version. *)
val get_SYSTEM : unit -> version

(** [version ()] gives the SWI-prolog version as a string. *)
val version : unit -> string

(** [get_FLI ()] gives the version for the foreign interface, which is
    incremented when a change breaks backward compatibility). *)
val get_FLI : unit -> int

(** [get_REC ()] gives the version for the binary representation, as used
    by [record_external] and [fast_write/2]. *)
val get_REC : unit -> int

(** [get_QLF ()] gives the version of the QLF file format. *)
val get_QLF : unit -> int

(** [get_QLF_LOAD ()] gives the oldest loadable QLF file format version. *)
val get_QLF_LOAD : unit -> int

(** [get_VM ()] gives a hash that represents the VM instructions and their
    arguments. *)
val get_VM : unit -> int

(** [get_BUILT_IN ()] gives a hash that represents the names, arities and
    properties of all built-in predicates defined in C. If this function is
    called before initialisation it returns [None]. *)
