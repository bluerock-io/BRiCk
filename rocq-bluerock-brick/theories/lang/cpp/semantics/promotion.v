(** * Type-level semantics of type promotions

    This captures the rules that C++ uses to promote values to integral types for
    the purposes of performing computation.

    This file contains *only* static-semantics, i.e. determining what casts should
    be performed. The dynamic semantics of casts is defined in [semantics/cast.v]

(** ** Integral Promotion
    This is used to promote a type to a type that supports arithmetic operators.
    For example, it converts types smaller than `int` to `int` (of some signedness).
    Because it converts `enum` types to integral types, it takes a [translation_unit].

    The operation is partial for non-integral types, e.g. struct types.

    Note that integral promotion does *not* change the value in the C++ semantics;
    however, it does change from [Vchar] to an equivalent [Vint] in BRiCk's
    architecture-independent semantics.

    > A prvalue of an integer type other than `bool`, `char8_t`, `char16_t`,
    > `char32_t`, or `wchar_t` whose integer conversion rank ([conv.rank])
    > is less than the rank of `int` can be converted to a prvalue of type `int`
    > if int can represent all the values of the source type; otherwise, the
    > source prvalue can be converted to a prvalue of type `unsigned int`.

        types with higher conversion rank (in rank order, signed given
        preference over unsigned) (since C++11). If the value range is
        greater, no integral promotions apply;

        an unscoped enumeration type whose underlying type is
        fixed can be converted to its underlying type, and, if the
        underlying type is also subject to integral promotion, to the
        promoted underlying type. Conversion to the unpromoted underlying
        type is better for the purposes of overload resolution)

        NOTE: this only applies to `unscoped` enumerations; however, the
        program will never contain these sorts of implicit conversions for
        scoped enumerations, so we do not need to check this fact.

(** ** Arithmetic Promotion
  This computes a "join" on the types of the two arguments to an arithmetic
  operator.

  https://eel.is/c++draft/expr.arith.conv#1.3

  (1.3.1) If both operands have the same type, no further conversion is needed.
  (1.3.2) Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have
          unsigned integer types, the operand with the type of lesser integer
          conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater
          rank.
  (1.3.3) Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank
          greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand,
          the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the
          operand with unsigned integer type.
  (1.3.4) Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can
          represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned
          integer type, the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to
          the type of the operand with signed integer type.
  (1.3.5) Otherwise, both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type
          corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type.
