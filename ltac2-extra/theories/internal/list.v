  (** Note: We have a "smart" list mapper in ML that works in the [Proofview]
      monad and uses Caml's [==] to promote sharing.

      We cannot lift it to an external Ltac2 function [List.Smart.map] of type
      [('a -> 'a) -> 'a list -> 'a list] due to the way that Ltac2's [repr]
      for list works. Under the hood, it is roughly [List.map]. Every time a
      list crosses the FFI boundary, we get a new list.

      We could perhaps write a [List.Smart.map] function in Ltac2 by adding an
      external primitive [==] (on ML type [valexpr]). *)
End List.
