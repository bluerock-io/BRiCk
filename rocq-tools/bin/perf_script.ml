(* This program turns the spans of a JSON log file into "perf script" format.
   The result can be used with flamegraph-related tools. In particular, this
   includes https://profiler.firefox.com. Note that the spans are always put
   int the log, independently of log files.

   The output data can be directly concatenated with simultaneously generated
   Linux perf data ("perf record -k MONOTONIC_CLOCK" should be used for the
   clocks to be in sync), and then loaded similarly in a profiler. *)
