(** [to_json data] converts the given [data] into JSON. The produced object is
    formed of two fields:
    - ["i"] - an integer giving the CPU instruction count for the full "coqc"
      process (except the OCaml runtime initialization / finalization),
    - ["a"] - an array of objects giving data about each individual, toplevel  
      Coq command that was processed.
    The objects stored in the latter field contain the following fields:
    - ["l"] (integer) - the number of the line on which the command starts,
    - ["s"] (integer) - the index of the first command's byte in the file,
    - ["e"] (integer) - the index of the last command's byte in the file,
    - ["p"] (string) - the first few characters of the command (at least),
    - ["i"] (integer) - CPU instruction counts for the command. *)
val to_json : t -> JSON.t

(** [of_json o] tries to convert the JSON object [o] into profiling data. This
    only succeeds with [Some(_)] if [o] is well-formed, and [None] is returned
    otherwise. Objects [o] returned by [as_json] are guaranteed to be be well-
    formed. *)

(** Exception raised by [read]. *)
exception Read_error of string

(** [read_json path] opens the (JSON) file indentified by [path], and attempts
    to interpret it as profiing data. In case of error with file manipulation,
    the [Sys_error] exception is raised. If the contents of the file is not of
    the expected shape, then the [Read_error] exception is raised. *)
val read_json : string -> t

(** [write_json path data] converts the given [data] to JSON, and writes it to
    the file identified by [path]. The [Sys_error] exception is raised in case
    of a file manipulation error. *)
val write_json : string -> t -> unit

(** [add_noise p data] returns a copy of [data] with noise added to the fields
    containing instruction counts, timings or memory usage data. The parameter
    [p] indicates that values are changed by a factor of [p] at most. Example:
    if [p] is [0.1], then the added noise is at most 10% of the initial value,
    in absolute terms. *)
