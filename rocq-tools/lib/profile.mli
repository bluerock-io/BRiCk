(** [extract o] extracts per-command profiling data from the given JSON object
    [o], assumed to have been produced by running "coqc" with "-profile". Note
    that the exception [Error(_)] is raised if the object is not recognised as
    a well-formed Coq profiling data output. The [NoInstr] exception is raised
    if the profiling data does not contain instruction counts. This may happen
    if Coq was not compiled with instruction count support, or if the counters
    cannot be read for some reason (e.g., lack of privileges). *)
