Contributions
-----------------

In order to commit code to this repository, we require that you sign a contribution license agreement (CLA). This license agreement is standard and is essentially identical to the [Google CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual). If you are contributing code on behalf of a company, you will also need a corporate CLA (again, essentially identical to the [Google Corporate CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate)).

We will initiate a CLA when you open a [pull request](https://github.com/bluerock-io/BRiCk/pulls).
