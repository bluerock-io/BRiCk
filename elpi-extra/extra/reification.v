  (* Elpi integers are 63 bit signed integers (at least on 64 bit machines). We
     use Coq's own primitive signed integers to efficiently convert any closed
     Coq number term directly to an Elpi-compatible integer.

     NOTE: The functions below do not check for overflow. Neither does Elpi's
     own arithmetic. The naive strategy for translating binary Coq numbers by
     repeated multiplication will yield the wrong number if the input does not
     fit into a 63 bit signed integer.

     NOTE: The conversion of [nat] is slow, even with [vm_compute]. It could be
     a legitimate strategy to go through the string presentation. *)
